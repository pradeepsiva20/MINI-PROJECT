Step 1: User Registration and Login

To start, the blood portal requires a system for users to register and log in. During registration, users can sign up as either donors or recipients by providing essential details like their name, email, phone number, password, address, blood group, and role (donor or recipient).
Passwords should be securely stored in the database using a hashing mechanism such as bcrypt to protect user credentials.
Once registered, users can log in with their email or phone number and password. 
Authentication can be handled using a secure method like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions effectively.

Step 2: Dashboard

After logging in, users are directed to a personalized dashboard. Donors can update their availability status (e.g., active or inactive) and view pending blood requests.
Recipients, on the other hand, can view their posted blood requests and check their statuses. 
The dashboard serves as a central hub for managing all user activities, ensuring an intuitive experience.

Step 3: Blood Requests

Blood requests are a core functionality of the portal. 
Recipients can submit a new blood request by specifying the required blood group, quantity, urgency, and location. 
For convenience, location details can be enhanced using Google Maps integration, allowing recipients to provide precise geographical data.
Donors can browse through active blood requests filtered by criteria such as blood group and location, enabling them to respond to requests that match their availability and capacity to donate.

Step 4: Search and Match System

The portal includes a search and match system to connect donors and recipients efficiently. 
Recipients can search for donors by specifying their required blood group and proximity to their location. Similarly, donors can search for active requests matching their blood group and preferred areas.
Using Google Maps API, this feature visually displays results, providing a seamless and interactive way for users to find compatible matches.

Step 5: Notifications

Notifications play a critical role in keeping users informed about activities on the platform.
Real-time notifications can be implemented using technologies like Socket.IO or polling. 
For example, donors can be alerted when a matching request is created nearby, while recipients receive notifications when a donor accepts their blood request. 
Additionally, the system can send email confirmations or SMS alerts using services like Firebase or Twilio to ensure users stay updated, even outside the platform.

Step 6: Admin Panel

An admin panel is included for managing the platform effectively. 
Administrators can perform tasks such as approving or rejecting user registrations, resetting passwords, and managing blood requests.
The admin panel also allows monitoring platform activity and generating reports on metrics like the number of active donors, total blood requests, and resolved requests.
This central control system ensures the platform operates smoothly and adheres to quality standards.

Deployment and Database
The frontend of the blood portal can be deployed using services like Netlify or Vercel, while the backend can be hosted on platforms such as Heroku or AWS. 
For the database, MongoDB Atlas is a reliable choice for NoSQL storage, while SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL can also be used depending on the application's requirements.
The database will store user details, blood requests, and their statuses. 
The users' table will include fields for personal information, blood group, role, and availability status, while the requests table will track recipient details, requested blood group, quantity, location, and current status.
